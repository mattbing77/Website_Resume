  <h2>Education</h2>
  <h3>Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering</h3>
  <p>Mississippi State University - Starkville MS</p>
  <p>GPA: 3.50/4.00</p>
  <p>Graduating Dec. 2024</p>
  <h3>Associate in Arts (AA)</h3>
  <p>Pearl River Community College - Picayune MS</p>
  <p>Graduated May 2022</p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <h3>FNDR DFNDR (Jan 2023 - May 2023)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Collaboratively engineered an innovative proximity sensor system for garage parking. This
        advanced system utilizes precise distance measurement technology to guide drivers by indicating
        the optimal parking distance from the wall.</li>
    <li>Designed and developed real-time distance detection algorithm to accurately gauge vehicle-wall
        proximity with an intuitive LED-based feedback mechanism, providing clear visual cues for
        drivers to adjust vehicle positioning.</li>
    <li>Employed rigorous testing methods to ensure system reliability and accuracy under diverse
        parking conditions.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Ultrasonic Squatting Depth Sensor (Jun 2023 - Aug 2023)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Independently conceptualized and developed a barbell clip device aimed at enhancing squat training efficiency
         by alerting the user when optimal depth is reached.</li>
    <li>Engineered a motion-sensing mechanism that accurately detects the squat depth, ensuring precise feedback for each rep.</li>
    <li>Integrated a user-friendly alert system that notifies the user via a subtle signal, facilitating concentration 
        and form maintenance during exercise.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Nerf Quadruped Robot School Project (Aug 2023 - Nov 2023)</h3>
  <u1>
    <li>Engineered a specialized control system to integrate a Nerf gun with a Unitree GO1 quadruped
        robot, achieving automated aiming and firing.</li>
    <li>Implemented object recognition algorithms to identify and track human targets, optimizing robot
        positioning for accurate shooting.</li>
    <li>Utilized electromagnetic solenoids for triggering the Nerf gun, controlled through serial port
        communication.</li>
  </u1>
